### Hi there 👋 I'm Alice

And i'm currently taking a course in Engineering @ ISEL, and working full-time as Frontend Developer at [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).  
As of now, i'm working with React, Docker, Typescript, Svelte, JS, Python, and experimenting with Arduinos and RaspberryPi's

You should probably know that i love 🍄, to the point that i eat them as lunch snacks and i mostly rely on coffee everyday. I also have 3 cats that i like to show to everybody and can 🥁 a little bit.

### My dev gear
