<h3 id="hi-there-i-m-alice">Hi there 👋 I&#39;m Alice</h3>
<p>
And i&#39;m currently taking a course in Engineering @ ISEL, and working full-time as Frontend Developer at <a href="#">Sky</a>.<br>
As of now, i&#39;m working with React (and React Native &amp; RN for Web and Redux), Typescript, Svelte, Vue, ES6+ compliant JS, Python and Java, and experimenting writing apps for Fitbit and learning about GraphQL (this is awesome).<br/> 
In the future i would like to transition to an audio software engineer role, but i have to be good at low level languages (such as C++ or Obj-C), so yeah, not easy for a woman that does javascript </p>
<p>You should probably know that i love 🍄, to the point that i eat them as lunch snacks and i mostly rely on coffee everyday. One of my favourite hobbies is listening to 📡 (yep, i&#39;m trying to catch UFO&#39;s) but so far only got to see airplanes and hearing radio. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=full+disk+image+earth&amp;safe=active&amp;tbm=isch">One day i will be able to have a full-disk image of the planet Earth!</a></p>
<p>You can only find me at <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/alicescfernandes" target="blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
